              <p><em>Support guy aspiring to become a fullstack developer.</em></p>
              <br>
              <p>Originally I started off as a fitness fanatic doing coaching and personal training. I then wanted to go corporate and ended up moving to car sales. However, following a few years in the industry and some time to reflect during the covid19 pandemic, I remembered the love I had for computors and decided to take the risk of starting over entirely so that I could break into the IT industry.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Ofcourse knowing I did not keep in touch with technology much for the previous decade, the expectation was that my job prospects would be bleak. Luckily though, I got a break and was given the opportunity to work as an account support consultant for a web hosting provider which gave me some exposure to the development world and initiated my hunger to take things further.</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>This page is the first step of my journey to feed this hunger and become a fullstack developer</strong></p>
